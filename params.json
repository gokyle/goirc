{"body":"Package goirc implements a basic IRC client. goirc is implemented\r\naround the `Irc` structure. The package is well documented with\r\n`godoc`; for more information, check the documentation.\r\n\r\nAn IRC configuration can be read from a JSON file; see the NewIrc \r\nfunction. For example,\r\n\r\n```\r\nirc, err := goirc.NewIrc(\"config.json\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n`goirc` implements a number of commands that act on the `Irc` structure;\r\nan IRC session is initiated with the `Connect()` method. PRIVMSGs can\r\nbe sent with the `Msg` method, and data may be read from the session\r\nusing the `Recv` method. \r\n\r\nThe `Pong` method is designed to be used as a goroutine; when a line\r\nis returned from `Recv()`, the `pingRegex` can be used to determine\r\nwhether incoming data is a PING request:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclient, err := goirc.NewIrc(\"config.json\")\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nfunc isPing(msg string) (bool, string) {\r\n         if !pingRegex.MatchString(msg) {\r\n         \t    return false, \"\"\r\n         }\r\n         return pingRegex.ReplaceAllString(msg, \"$1\"), true\r\n }\r\n\r\n if pinged, sender := isPing(msg); pinged {\r\n         go client.Pong(sender)\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nThis package is provided under a dual ISC / public domain license.\r\n\r\nThe public domain license is the one applicable to the user of this\r\ncode; you are free to choose whichever affords the maximum freedom\r\nto you.\r\n\r\n### The ISC license:\r\n```\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Kyle Isom <kyle@tyrfingr.is>\r\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software for any\r\npurpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the\r\nabove copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL\r\nWARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED\r\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
